Casio fx-CG50 3pin communication

My plan is to get commmunication on the casio cg50 (and probably cg20 etc) by hacking on the 3pin (why is it an audio ) output, and connecting it via usb to a raspberry pi 0 w/ internet.

1.get free/open control of communication over 3pin 
2.hook to raspberry pi
3.application (probably a simple chat app idc)

part 2 is trivial in theory so im mainly gonna do part 1

# i just presses hashtag

from a teeny tiny bit of searching i found http://martin.poupe.org/casio/fxterm/index.html fxterm so I need to play with that soon.
